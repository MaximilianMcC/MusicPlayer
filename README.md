## General ideas
Below is a list of general ideas that I have when I'm making the project.
- Customizable themes where you can put in your own hex code or something.
- Blurred background of cover image. Could change entire programs theme by getting average color
- Very complex, but could be cool if it works. Something that can suggest other songs to you based off the songs you have in your library
- Way to share songs and playlists between people who also use the program. Could be a friend system, or a file that you send over.
