# ideas
These aren't confirmed and its not a todo list thing. Its just ideas.
- Clicking on the picture/text of an audio file will change the ID3 information
- Color themes can be exported so people can share them
- Color themes can just be colors, or more advanced users can chuck some custom css in there
- Selecting multiple files makes it a playlist
- Can do "open with" on files to open them
